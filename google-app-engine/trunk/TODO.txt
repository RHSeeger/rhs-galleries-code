Things to do:
* Go through code and handle any TODO notes there
* See if we can use memcache to cache the data for galleries for a period of time 
  even 1 minute would probably be good
* add a favicon
* Update the color scheme... it's ugly
** What this is, where it's info comes from, link to sourceforge, who I am
* Add actual google ads
