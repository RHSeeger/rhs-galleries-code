Things to do:
* Go through code and handle TODO notes there
* Convert flickr ingestion to threaded so we can get all galleries at once
* Add timestamp to galleries
** Add task to remove old (>24 hours?) galleries from data
* Add ability to look at old galleries, ui element for this?
* Remove the OSIV configuration, we're not using it
* Add sample photo to galleries so that we don't need to pull down all photos just for main page
* Go through and figure out where we should actually be closing sessions, so we don't leak them
* See if we can convert in memory db to disk based
